# toy-models environments

Repository containing the toy-models environments to explore parameter spaces with Reinforcement Learning. The environment package is in the toy-models folder. 

## Using Stable Baselines

[Stable Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html#) is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch. An example using the SAC algorithm in our custom environment with tensorboard integration and model saving, can be found in the `stable_baselines` folder.
